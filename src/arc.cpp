offsets, which are given. It is checked that the end point lies one

/* arc_data_comp_r

Returned Value: int
If any of the following errors occur, this returns the error code shown.
Otherwise, it returns RS274NGC_OK.
1. The arc radius is too small to reach the end point:
NCE_RADIUS_TOO_SMALL_TO_REACH_END_POINT
2. The arc radius is not greater than the tool_radius, but should be:
NCE_TOOL_RADIUS_NOT_LESS_THAN_ARC_RADIUS_WITH_COMP
3. An imaginary value for offset would be found, which should never
happen if the theory is correct: NCE_BUG_IN_TOOL_RADIUS_COMP

Side effects:
This finds and sets the values of center_x, center_y, and turn.

Called by: convert_arc_comp1

This finds the center coordinates and number of full or partial turns
counterclockwise of a helical or circular arc (call it arc1) in
r-format in the XY plane.  Arc2 is constructed so that it is tangent
to a circle whose radius is tool_radius and whose center is at the
point (current_x, current_y) and passes through the point (end_x,
end_y). Arc1 has the same center as arc2. The radius of arc1 is one
tool radius larger or smaller than the radius of arc2.

If the value of the big_radius argument is negative, that means [NCMS,
page 21] that an arc larger than a semicircle is to be made.
Otherwise, an arc of a semicircle or less is made.

The algorithm implemented here is to construct a line L from the
current point to the end point, and a perpendicular to it from the
center of the arc which intersects L at point P. Since the distance
from the end point to the center and the distance from the current
point to the center are known, two equations for the length of the
perpendicular can be written. The right sides of the equations can be
set equal to one another and the resulting equation solved for the
length of the line from the current point to P. Then the location of
P, the length of the perpendicular, the angle of the perpendicular,
and the location of the center, can be found in turn.

This needs to be better documented, with figures. There are eight
possible arcs, since there are three binary possibilities: (1) tool
inside or outside arc, (2) clockwise or counterclockwise (3) two
positions for each arc (of the given radius) tangent to the tool
outline and through the end point. All eight are calculated below,
since theta, radius2, and turn may each have two values.

To see two positions for each arc, imagine the arc is a hoop, the
tool is a cylindrical pin, and the arc may rotate around the end point.
The rotation covers all possible positions of the arc. It is easy to
see the hoop is constrained by the pin at two different angles, whether
the pin is inside or outside the hoop.

Returned Value: double (length of path between start and end points)

Side effects: none

Called by:
inverse_time_rate_arc
inverse_time_rate_arc2
inverse_time_rate_as

This calculates the length of the path that will be made relative to
the XYZ axes for a motion in which the X,Y,Z, motion is a circular or
helical arc with its axis parallel to the Z-axis. If tool length
compensation is on, this is the path of the tool tip; if off, the
length of the path of the spindle tip. Any rotary axis motion is
ignored.

If the arc is helical, it is coincident with the hypotenuse of a right
triangle wrapped around a cylinder. If the triangle is unwrapped, its
base is [the radius of the cylinder times the number of radians in the
helix] and its height is [z2 - z1], and the path length can be found
by the Pythagorean theorem.

This is written as though it is only for arcs whose axis is parallel to
the Z-axis, but it will serve also for arcs whose axis is parallel
to the X-axis or Y-axis, with suitable permutation of the arguments.

This works correctly when turn is zero (find_turn returns 0 in that
case).

/* find_straight_length

Returned Value: double (length of path between start and end points)

Side effects: none

Called by:
inverse_time_rate_straight
inverse_time_rate_as

This calculates a number to use in feed rate calculations when inverse
time feed mode is used, for a motion in which X,Y,Z,A,B, and C each change
linearly or not at all from their initial value to their end value.

This is used when the feed_reference mode is CANON_XYZ, which is
always in rs274NGC.

If any of the X, Y, or Z axes move or the A-axis, B-axis, and C-axis
do not move, this is the length of the path relative to the XYZ axes
from the first point to the second, and any rotary axis motion is
ignored. The length is the simple Euclidean distance.

The formula for the Euclidean distance "length" of a move involving
only the A, B and C axes is based on a conversation with Jim Frohardt at
Boeing, who says that the Fanuc controller on their 5-axis machine
interprets the feed rate this way. Note that if only one rotary axis
moves, this formula returns the absolute value of that axis move,
which is what is desired.
